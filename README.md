Learning Process on Hack the Box 

The learning pyramid (also known as “the cone of learning”, “the learning cone”, “the cone of retention”, “the pyramid of learning”, or “the pyramid of retention”) is a group of popular learning models and representations relating different degrees of retention induced from various type of learning. The representations is generally via percentages and discrete layers within a "pyramid of learning". The divide is generally 10, 20, 30, 50 and 90 percent.
==========================================
The earliest such representation is believed to originate in a 1954 book called Audio-Visual Methods in Teaching.[1] A pyramid model was developed by the National Training Laboratories Institute in the early 1960s, on its main campus in Bethel, Maine, for which the original, internal research has been lost. This NTL's learning pyramid model still became a central representation of this concept with a large number of models drawing from it. This NTL's model generally displays the following representation.


Learning Pyramid or Cone of Learning
Retention rate	Learning activity before test of knowledge
90%	Teach someone else/use immediately.
75%	Practice what one learned.
50%	Engage in a group discussion.
30%	Watch a demonstration.
20%	Watch audiovisual.
10%	Read.
5%	Listen to a lecture.
